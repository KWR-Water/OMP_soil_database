Overview

SSTR (SubSurface TRansport) is a model to calculate the behavior of Organic
MicroPollutants (OMPs) and pathogens for 4 standard types of Public Supply Well
Fields (PSWFs), which cover the most frequently occurring and most vulnerable
groundwater resources for drinking water supply in the Netherlands (and Flanders).
One of the aims of this approach is to forecast the behavior of new OMPs in
groundwater. Groundwater is often overlooked in current environmental risk
assessment methods, which are a priori or a posteriori applied when new organic
chemicals appear on the market

The 4 standard PSWF types consist of a phreatic, a semiconfined, a Basin Artificial
Recharge (BAR) and River Bank Filtration (RBF) well field, each predefined with
representative, standard hydrogeological, hydrological and hydrogeochemical
characteristics.

This python version is based on the Lite+ version of the OMP transport model 'TRANSATOMIC'
(acronym: TRANS Aquifer Transport Of MicroContaminants, developed by P.Stuyfzand)
in which concentration changes are calculated with analytical solutions set in Excel spreadsheet.

The model has been expanded to include Modflow solutions, in addition to the analytical
solutions and to include pathogens in addition to OMP.

Steps
-----

Operating the analytical module typically involves 5 steps:

#. Define the hydrogeochemical system using the HydroChemicalSchematisation class. 
#. Run the AnalyticalWell class to calculate the travel time distribution in the different aquifer zones
#. Run the Substance class to retrieve the substance (removal) parameters
#. Run the SubstanceTransport class to calculate the removal and concentration in each zone and in the well
#. Plot the desired functions

Now, letâ€™s try some examples. First we import the necessary python packages

.. ipython:: python

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import os
    import sys
    from pathlib import Path

    import sutra.removal_functions as RF
