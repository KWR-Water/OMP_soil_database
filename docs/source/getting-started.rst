Sutra is a python package to calculate the advective removal of microbial organisms 
(also called 'pathogens') from source to end_point.

Main features:
 - Includes database of removal parameters for microbial organisms. 
 - Calculate the removal and concentration of the microbial organism over distance, and with time   

Install
-------
Sutra requires Python 3.8 or later.

To get Sutra, use the following command::

  pip install git+https://github.com/KWR-Water/sutra.git

Sutra calculates the subsurface removal of microbial organisms over a distance and with time using an analytical approach.  
The aim is to allow for a quick assessment of subsurface removal of microbial organisms for a growing selection of species.    
A database was added, starting with plant pathogens 'solani' (Dickeya solani), 'carotovorum' (Pectobacterium carotovorum), 
and 'solanacearum' (Ralstonia solanacearum). Additional species will be added once more data will become available.
